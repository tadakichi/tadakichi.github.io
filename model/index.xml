      <description>The model we used so far is backtested under quite a rough assumption.
Problems according to there assumptions are following:  Extract the portfolio at the end date of the month, and simulate investment at the same date. When calculating portfolio return, simply average each stocks&amp;rsquo; returns. This may exclude the possibility that we cannot fully invest available cash(if we can invest 2,000,000 dollars in each stock, and the stock price of the day is 1,000,000 dollar, It means We can invest only one stock.</description>

      <description>This time, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna explain the model I&amp;rsquo;m using for real investment. This model is the base model, so it will be the base when comparing with updates or changes.
Here is the simple diagram of the quant process.
 model   Every process except evaluation is calculated in rebalancing period, and evaluation is calculated in monthly.
And here are simulation results.
 fromDate=2006-12-31, toDate=2015-12-31
Total return: 1407.9304% of 108 months</description>
